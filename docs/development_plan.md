# Risk Tracking Single-Page Web Application Development Plan

## 1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- [ ] Choose between React or Vue.js for the frontend framework
- [ ] Set up the development environment (Node.js, npm/yarn)
- [ ] Initialize the project using create-react-app or Vue CLI
- [ ] Set up version control (Git repository)
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (e.g., PocketDB, CouchDB client library)

## 2. Backend Setup
- [ ] Install and configure CouchDB
- [ ] Set up PocketDB for syncing with CouchDB
- [ ] Create necessary databases and views in CouchDB

## 3. Frontend Development - Core Structure
- [ ] Create the basic single-page application structure
- [ ] Implement responsive layout (CSS Grid or Flexbox)
- [ ] Set up routing (if needed) for different views within the SPA

## 4. Data Management and State
- [ ] Implement state management (e.g., React Context, Redux, or Vuex)
- [ ] Create data models for projects, risks, assessments, and comments
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for risks
- [ ] Set up PocketDB syncing with CouchDB

## 5. Risk Matrix Component
- [ ] Create a 5x5 grid component for the risk matrix
- [ ] Implement color-coding for risk levels
- [ ] Develop logic to position risks within the matrix based on likelihood and impact

## 6. Risk List and Details Component
- [ ] Create a component to display the list of risks
- [ ] Implement risk reordering functionality (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Develop a component to display risk details
- [ ] Implement risk selection and detail view updating

## 7. Risk Form Component
- [ ] Create a form component for adding/editing risks
- [ ] Implement form validation
- [ ] Add sliders for likelihood and impact values
- [ ] Implement comment functionality

## 8. Data Synchronization and Offline Capabilities
- [ ] Implement real-time syncing with PocketDB
- [ ] Develop offline data storage and syncing when online

## 9. JSON File Generation
- [ ] Implement functionality to generate project-specific JSON files
- [ ] Ensure JSON files are stored in CouchDB

## 10. User Interface Refinement
- [ ] Implement loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Refine the overall design and ensure consistency
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices

## 11. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for key components and functions
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT)

## 12. Documentation
- [ ] Write technical documentation
- [ ] Create user guide and help documentation

## 13. Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure CouchDB for production use
- [ ] Deploy static assets alongside CouchDB
- [ ] Perform final testing in the production environment

## 14. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan for future updates and improvements
