# Risk Tracking Single-Page Web Application

This project is a single-page web application designed to help users effectively manage and track risks associated with their projects. 

The application will allow users to:

* Define risks with titles, descriptions, and initial assessments (likelihood and impact).
* Update risk assessments over time.
* Add comments to risks for discussion and tracking.
* Reorder risks within the application.
* Visualize risks on a 

The application will be built using a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js and will utilize CouchDB for data storage and PocketDB for syncing.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.com/).

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd risk-tracking-app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.
github.
com/facebook/create-react-app/docs/running-tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.
github.
com/facebook/create-react-app/docs/deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
